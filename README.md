# Bonavox

An IPA-based speech synthesis tool meant for sound-matching and dynamic speech generation. 


## History

Speech synthesis was gaining public attention and discussion regarding mobile technologies and artifical intelligence, and yet its limitations were clear in terms of accuracy. Concerned with both monosyllabic and polysllyabic utterances, Bonavox saught to remedy accuracy and efficient sound matching/combination through use of the International Phonetic Alphabet. Design ultimately used the task of music (vocal) production as a primary goal with the synthesis.

The project was founded and spearheaded by Ian M. McCann, then of Northside College Prep and currently undergraduate student at the University of Chicago. Development was co-lead by [Robert J. Altman](https://github.com/rjaltman), and a committee of 5-6 individuals (including the aforementioned two) rounded out project design.

A short note: While the repository was created by Altman, most of the text and concept cleared for this page comes from McCann's work and publication.

## So, what happened?

Bonavox was, at its time, an ambitious project that invoked discussions, introduced new hands on deck for concept development, and a means of practicing newly acquired skills in Java with an applicable interdisciplinary focus. However, with the rise of Pentelec Familiar in the later first half of 2012, much of the discussion went silent to reflect the new shift. 

Sadly, due to the majority of Bonavox's prominence being found in internal conversations at Pentelec, much of the progress on the project's conception is not visible here. Indeed, only the very beginning of actual program development is reproduced here.

## Is it still around?

Yes, and no. Bonavox's existence is about as certain as Pentelec's very own. However, this repository is mostly offered as historical evidence of the project.
